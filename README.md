Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, teasting, and maintaining software applications in a structured and eficint manner.

Software Engineering is important as explained below:
1. Software Engineering bridges the gap of innovation and invention as it allows creation of video games, mobie apps, web apps, robots and to a complex systems such as Operating systems.

2. Software engineering involves solvong of puzzles, which makes every cording practice exciting.

3. The innovation aspect of software Engineering allows us to solve world biggest problems, and therefore, the applications developed turns to be a help to many people worldwide.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The term was introduced at a NATO conference to address the "software crisis," highlighting the need for structured software development.
2. Agile Methodology (2001) – The Agile Manifesto introduced flexible and iterative development, improving collaboration and adaptability in software projects.
3. Cloud Computing & DevOps (2006s-Present) – The rise of cloud platforms and DevOps practices revolutionized software deployment, automation, and scalability.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning – Define project scope, goals, and feasibility.
2. Requirements Gathering – Collect and analyze what the software needs to do.
3. Design – Create system architecture and UI/UX designs.
4. Development – Write and implement the actual code.
5. Testing – Identify and fix bugs, ensuring functionality.
6. Deployment – Release the software to users.
7. Maintenance – Update, optimize, and fix issues post-release.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
